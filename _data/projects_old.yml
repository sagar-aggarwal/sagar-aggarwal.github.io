  caption: Exploring alternatives is a key part of interface design, yet processes for creating alternatives are mostly manual. We 
    created <b>Scout</b>, a system to help designers explore alternatives rapidly through <b>mixed-initiative interaction with high-level 
    constraints</b> and design feedback. We formalized design concepts combined with high-level constraints into low-level spatial 
    constraints to enable rapidly generating layout alternatives through constraint solving and synthesis.

  caption: Tapping is an immensely important gesture in mobile interfaces, yet people still frequently are required
    to learn which elements are tappable through trial and error. We created <b>TapShoe</b>, an approach for modeling 
    the tappability of mobile interfaces at scale. We collected a crowdsourced dataset of over 20k tappability labels
    and built a deep learning model to evaluate tappability automatically which interface designers can use to evaluate
    this key aspect of usability without needing to collect any data.

  caption: Interface designers frequently adapt screenshot examples into designs, yet, images are unstructured and difficult to edit. We
    created <b>Rewire</b>, an interactive system that helps designers leverage example screenshots by automatically inferring a vector representation
    of a screenshot where UI components have editble shape and style properties. We demonstrate that Rewire can help designers reconstruct 
    and edit example designs more efficiently compared to a baseline tool. # in JSON.

  caption: Most web applications are designed as one-size-fits-all, despite considerable variation in peopleâ€™s expertise, physical abilities, and other factors that impact interaction.
    We created <b>Genie</b>, a system that reverse engineers an abstract model of the underlying commands in a web application, 
    then enables interaction with that functionality through alternative interfaces and other input modalities (e.g., speech, keyboard, or command line input).

  caption: Interface designers use human performance models to compare designs to legacy systems or competitors' interfaces, yet 
    these models require manual creation of storyboards in human performance modeling tools (i.e., CogTool). We created a system to automatically generate storyboards and predictive models for desktop interfaces to help UI 
    designers estimate human task performance (CHI 2012), and detect human performance regressions in interfaces (ICSE 2013). # in JSON.

    and highlight them to help people see what has changed since they last visited a webpage. This was done as part of a class project
    for INSC 570 - Research Design.

  caption: End users with little software background develop software like spreadsheets, web mashups, and macros. We investigated whether versioning capabilities could help end users develop, understand, and reuse web mashups. Our results showed that 
    versioning allowed mashup creators to perform mashup creation tasks more correctly in less time than users without versioning, while also improving reusability.

  caption: We created a reformulation strategy for solving multi-dimensional constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs),

    of an instance of the game of SET, and deployed it in a web interface for playing SET that provided automatic hints.
