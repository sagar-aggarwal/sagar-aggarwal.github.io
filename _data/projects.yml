  caption: BHAAV is the first and largest Hindi text corpus for analyzing emotions that a writer expresses through his/her characters in a story, as perceived by a narrator/reader. The corpus consists of 20,304 sentences collected from 230 different short stories spanning across 18 genres such as प्रेरणादायक (Inspirational) and रहस्यमयी (Mystery). Each sentence has been annotated into one of the five emotion categories anger, joy, suspense, sad, and neutral.

- Sucide Ideation:
  name: Exploring the Impact of Evolutionary Computing based Feature Selection in Suicidal Ideation Detection
  featured: true
  url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8858989
  caption: The ubiquitous availability of smartphones and the increasing popularity of social media provide a platform for users to express their feelings, including suicidal ideation. Suicide prevention by suicidal ideation detection on social media lights the path to controlling the rapidly increasing suicide rates amongst youth. This paper proposes a diverse set of features and investigates into feature selection using the Firefly algorithm to build an efficient and robust supervised approach to classifying tweets with suicidal ideation. The development of a suicidal language to create three diverse, manually annotated datasets leads to the validation of the proposed model. An in-depth result and error analysis lead to an accurate system for monitoring suicidal ideation on social media along with the discovery of optimal feature subsets and selection methods using a penalty based Firefly algorithm.

  caption: Analysis of EEG (Electroencephalography) signals provides an alternative ingenious approach towards Emotion recognition. Nowadays, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) have emerged as state-of-the-art supervised classification techniques used for robust modeling of various standard machine learning problems. In this paper, two GBM's (XGBoost and LightGBM) were used for emotion classification on DEAP Dataset. Furthermore, a participant independent model was fabricated by excluding participant number from features. The proposed approach performed well with high accuracies and faster training speed.
