  caption: BHAAV is the first and largest Hindi text corpus for analyzing emotions that a writer expresses through his/her characters in a story, as perceived by a narrator/reader. The corpus consists of 20,304 sentences collected from 230 different short stories spanning across 18 genres such as प्रेरणादायक (Inspirational) and रहस्यमयी (Mystery). Each sentence has been annotated into one of the five emotion categories anger, joy, suspense, sad, and neutral.

- Sucide Ideation:
  name: Exploring the Impact of Evolutionary Computing based Feature Selection in Suicidal Ideation Detection
  featured: true

  caption: The ubiquitous availability of smartphones and the increasing popularity of social media provide a platform for users to express their feelings, including suicidal ideation. Suicide prevention by suicidal ideation detection on social media lights the path to controlling the rapidly increasing suicide rates amongst youth. This paper proposes a diverse set of features and investigates into feature selection using the Firefly algorithm to build an efficient and robust supervised approach to classifying tweets with suicidal ideation. The development of a suicidal language to create three diverse, manually annotated datasets leads to the validation of the proposed model. An in-depth result and error analysis lead to an accurate system for monitoring suicidal ideation on social media along with the discovery of optimal feature subsets and selection methods using a penalty based Firefly algorithm.

  caption: This project was a part of my Bachelor’s thesis focused on creating a hybrid model for EEG Analysis in Brain Computer Interfaces(BCI). The objective was to come up with a unique general purpose classifier that can fit multiple EEG datasets efficiently. We began by generating an extended feature set for the datasets. After dynamic feature selection and dimensionality reduction, we juxtapose the performance metrics for various classifiers and seek to build a hybrid classifier. Further, this study is extended to suggest a general purpose tool named EFEACT (EEG Feature extraction and Classification Tool).

  caption: Given a lexicon along with their meanings and comparison pairs generated from Best Worst Scaling Algorithm, the tool provides a UI for annotators to generate comparison results which can later be used to create a rating scale. This tool was part of research project done as an Intern at MIDAS Lab, IIITD.
